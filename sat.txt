dpll with watched counting variables:

function DPLL_count(F)
	if F is a consistent set of literals
		//then return true;
		for each watched counting variable that is either not set or true,
			count the possibilities and add to results
	if F contains an empty clause
		return and don't increment anything
		//then return false;
	for every unit clause {l} in F
		F <- unit-propagate(l, F);
	for every literal l that occurs pure in F
		F <- pure-literal-assign(l, F); //MAKE IT FREE but ignore it now
	//l ? choose-literal(F);
		//return DPLL(F ? {l}) or DPLL(F ? {not(l)});
	DPLL_count(F ? {l});
	DPLL_count(F ? {not(l)});


need to formulate as a SAT problem now
