Bitmask approach:
Keep track of individual usable positions for each ship (index them, only use valid ones)
Solve pairwise conflicts

Recurse on bitmask
In the bottom level of recursion,
increment the counter values associated with each position for each ship
(or do this with valid-count return values and multiplication)

keep track of hits count along the way

At the end, use the draw function to draw that count onto the final grid
